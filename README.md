# thermostat-challenge

In this challenge I will build a business logic to model a simple thermostat, and learn to hook it up to a dynamic visual interface using jQuery - all within the browser. I will also use JavaScript to fetch data from external sources and display that on the page - again, all right from the page. Underpinning all this will be a new testing framework to help you test-drive your JavaScript code - Jasmine.
